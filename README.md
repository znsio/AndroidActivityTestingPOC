# AndroidActivityTesting Proof-of-Concept
This is intended to be a simple project to help devise effective testing of Android Activities. It's inspired by reading the work of many others and an attempt to establish a reliable, repeatable and maintainable test automation codebase that's actually useful. 

## Contributions are welcome
This project scratches an itch I and a couple of others have, where the current documentation wasn't quite enough and where many examples are incomplete or too dated to work as-is now the tools and releases have moved on significantly since those were written.
